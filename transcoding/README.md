Transcoding module
==================

We are adding the `transcoding` module to add the ability to transcode an extra
video format on top of the already existing format.


## Discovering transcoding formats

How VideoFront knows about the transcoding format to use when a video
gets in for the first time?

It uses this setting :

    ELASTIC_TRANSCODER_PRESETS = [
        ('LD', '1351620000001-000030', 900),  # System preset: Generic 480p 4:3
        ('SD', '1351620000001-000010', 2400), # System preset: Generic 720p
        ('HD', '1474271974931-39nker', 5400), # System preset: Generic 1080p - FUN (1080p + 1024x1024 thumbnails)
    ]

Now, imagine that you want to apply a new preset. You don't want to re-run the
3 initial transcoding operations again. That's why, we use use this module.

Here is the setting where you put the new format to be applied to existing videos.

    ELASTIC_TRANSCODER_NEW_PRESETS = [
        ('UL', '1499875722465-ygtqxq', 256),  # Fun-Mooc 320x240
    ]


## Usage example

This command looks at all videos for the given course and calculates the cost
for running the transcoding.

    transcode.estimate_cost('course-v1:fun+fun+session01')

This command runs the transcoding. It will also run the cost estimation
before transcoding.

    transcode.transcode_for_courses('course-v1:fun+fun+session01')


## Cost Estimation

This module does an estimation of the transcoding cost.
It's based on the explanations found on the official Amazon doc.

The pricing used is : Standard Definition â€“ SD (Resolution of less than 720p) $0.017 per minute


## Courses with multiple sessions

If you want to transcode videos for a course with multiple sessions, you will
be interested to read this.

VideoFront puts videos in "Playlist". Each course is mapped to a playlist. That means, that
"Session 2" of a course has a different playlit than "Session 1".

Often, you will have videos spread within multiple playlists, beacuse there were multiple
runs of the course. How to make sure that you grab all videos for you mulltiple-session
course?

You should pass all the sessions of the course this way - separated by spaces:

    transcode.transcode_for_courses('course-v1:fun+fun+session01 course-v1:fun+fun+session02 course-v1:fun+fun+session03')


## Logging

This module uses Python logging to log to the console and also to the file system.

Look inside the code to see where log entries are sent. File logging would be for instance
in `/var/tmp/video-transcode.log`


## Dependencies

This module depends on `ffprobe` wich is found on Ubuntu 14 in the `ffmpeg` package.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
